## üéØ What is Fretboard-King?

Fretboard-King is an interactive guitar fretboard learning application designed to help guitar players of all levels master note recognition and fretboard knowledge. Through a gamified quiz system, players can rapidly improve their ability to identify notes anywhere on the guitar neck.

The app presents users with a visual representation of a guitar fretboard and challenges them to identify random notes through multiple-choice questions. With immediate feedback, score tracking, and progress visualization, Fretboard-King transforms the often tedious process of learning fretboard theory into an engaging and rewarding experience.
