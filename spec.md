# Functional Specification: Guitar Fretboard Learning Application

## Last updated: July 2, 2025

## 1. Overview
This application is a cross-platform, interactive trainer to help guitar players learn and master the fretboard. It uses a gamified quiz approach to reinforce note recognition and fretboard knowledge. The app is designed to run on any device (web, desktop, mobile) using web technologies.

## 2. Core User Experience
- The main screen displays an interactive guitar fretboard (default: 6 strings, 12 frets).
- At regular intervals, a random fret flashes/highlights.
- The user is prompted with a multiple-choice question: "Which note is this?" with three options.
- The user has a limited time (e.g., 3-5 seconds) to answer by selecting one of the options.
- Immediate feedback is given: correct answers increase the score, incorrect answers do not.
- The user's current score is always visible.
- The user's score from the previous day is also displayed for motivation.

## 3. Key Features
- Interactive fretboard visualization (HTML table/grid, touch/click enabled).
- Fret markers at standard positions (3, 5, 7, 9, 12).
- Multiple-choice quiz with random note/fret selection.
- Timed answers (configurable, default 3-5 seconds).
- Local storage of daily scores and progress.
- Responsive design for all screen sizes.
- Customization: fretboard color, marker style, left-handed mode.
- Accessibility: colorblind-friendly, ARIA labels, touch-friendly.

## 4. Future/Optional Features

## 5. MVP Scope
