# Brainstorming: Guitar Fretboard Learning Application

## Date: July 2, 2025

### Project Vision
Create a cross-platform application to help guitar players learn and master the fretboard, enabling them to quickly identify notes, patterns, and intervals anywhere on the neck. The app should be accessible on web, desktop, and mobile devices.

---

## Initial Brainstorming Ideas

### 1. Core Features
- Interactive fretboard visualization: Users can click/tap on frets and strings to see note names, intervals, and scales.
- Practice modes: Quizzes, flashcards, and games to test note recognition and fretboard knowledge.
- Customizable tunings: Support for standard and alternate tunings.
- Progress tracking: Track user improvement over time with stats and achievements.
- Audio feedback: Play the sound of the note when a fret is selected.

### 2. Learning Modes
- Guided lessons: Step-by-step exercises for beginners to advanced players.
- Random note challenge: App highlights a fret, user must name the note (or vice versa).
- Scale and chord explorer: Visualize and practice scales/chords across the fretboard.
- Interval training: Identify intervals between two notes on the fretboard.

### 3. Technology Considerations
- Cross-platform: Use web technologies (React, Svelte, or similar) with a framework like Electron or Tauri for desktop, and React Native or Capacitor for mobile.
- Progressive Web App (PWA): Allow installation on any device with offline support.
- Modular architecture: Easy to add new instruments or features in the future.

### 4. Gamification & Engagement
- Achievements and badges for milestones.
- Leaderboards for competitive practice.
- Daily challenges and streaks.

### 5. Accessibility & Customization
- Colorblind-friendly modes.
- Adjustable fretboard size and color themes.
- Support for left-handed players.

### 6. Community & Sharing
- Share progress or custom exercises with friends.
- User-generated content: Allow users to create and share their own quizzes or lessons.

## Next Steps
- Research similar apps for inspiration and differentiation.
- Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product) feature set.
- Choose technology stack based on target platforms.
- Sketch initial UI/UX wireframes.

### July 2, 2025 — Additional Brainstorming

- **Universal Device Support:**
  - Prioritize web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript) for maximum compatibility across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
  - Consider building as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for installability and offline use.

- **Fretboard Visualization Implementation:**
  - Use an HTML table or grid to represent the fretboard, with rows as strings and columns as frets.
  - Each cell can be interactive (click/tap) to reveal note names, intervals, or quiz prompts.
  - Style the table to visually resemble a guitar fretboard, including string/fret lines and wood textures.

- **Fret Markers:**
  - Visually highlight fret markers at standard positions (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th frets, etc.).
  - Use circles, dots, or custom SVG graphics for markers.
  - Option to toggle marker visibility for learning or challenge modes.

- **Gamification & Quiz Ideas:**
  - Quiz mode: App highlights a fret, user must select the correct note, or vice versa.
  - Timed challenges: Identify as many notes as possible in a set time.
  - Streaks and rewards for consecutive correct answers.

- **Customization:**
  - Allow users to change fretboard colors and marker styles.
  - Support for left-handed mode (mirror the fretboard).

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure the fretboard is responsive and touch-friendly.
  - Use accessible color schemes and ARIA labels for screen readers.

### July 2, 2025 — Interactive Quiz & Scoring Ideas

- **Flashing Fret Quiz Mechanic:**
  - Randomly select a fret to "flash" (highlight) on the fretboard.
  - Prompt the user with a multiple-choice question: "Which note is this?" with three options (e.g., C#, F#, D).
  - User has a limited time (e.g., 3-5 seconds) to select the answer.
  - Provide immediate feedback: score increases for correct answers, no score for incorrect.

- **Scoring & Progress Tracking:**
  - Display the current session score prominently during the quiz.

---

### July 2, 2025 — Score History & Visualization Ideas

- **Score History Visualization:**
  - Add a bar chart to display the user's daily scores for the last 30 days.
  - Each bar represents one day's score, allowing users to see trends and progress over time.
  - Chart should be visible on the main screen, below or next to the current score.
  - Store daily scores in localStorage as a date-to-score mapping (e.g., `{ '2025-07-01': 10, '2025-07-02': 7, ... }`).
  - Optionally, allow users to hover/tap on a bar to see the exact score and date.
  - Use a simple chart library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts) or a custom SVG/Canvas implementation for the bar chart.

---
  - Show the user's score from the previous day for motivation and progress tracking.
  - Store daily scores locally (and later, optionally, in the cloud for logged-in users).

- **Future Features:**
  - Add a leaderboard for competitive play (local or online).
  - Allow users to log in with an account to track progress across devices.
  - For MVP, focus on the core trainer and local score tracking before adding accounts/leaderboards.
